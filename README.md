# MiniGrep Project

This simple MiniGrep project is based on the Rust programming language and follows the example provided in the Rust book. It allows you to search for a specific query within the content of a given file, supporting case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches.

## Usage

To use the MiniGrep application, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run <query> <file_path>
```
- `<query>`: The string you want to search for.
- `<file_path>`: The path to the file in which you want to perform the search.

Optional Environment Variable:

- `IGNORE_CASE`: Set this environment variable to perform a case-insensitive search.

## Acknowledgments

This MiniGrep project is based on examples from the Rust book, providing a simple yet practical demonstration of file searching functionality. For more information, refer to [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Feel free to explore and modify the code for your learning and experimentation.
